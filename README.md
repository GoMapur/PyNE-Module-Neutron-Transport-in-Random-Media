# PyNE-Module-Neutron-Transport-in-Random-Media
This code solves the steady-state, monoenergetic transport equation in a homogeneous medium with isotropic scattering and isotropic source in rod and slab (sn) geometries. It uses 2-point central differencing (order h^2) with 3-point forward/backward at the boundaries. Thanks Richard Vasques &amp; Nitin Kumar Yadav
